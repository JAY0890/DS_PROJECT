Project Summary:-
In an age where misinformation spreads rapidly online, detecting fake news has become increasingly important. This project aims to build a simple machine learning model that can classify news articles as fake or real, using basic features such as title length, text length, presence of images, author information, and other metadata.
The goal is to apply foundational data science techniques—such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and basic classification models—without relying on complex natural language processing (NLP). This makes it an ideal beginner-level project to understand the practical applications of supervised learning.


About the Dataset:-
The dataset used in this project contains 2083 news articles with various metadata fields. Each record in the dataset includes the following features:
Feature Name
Description
author
Name of the article's author
published
Date and time when the article was published (datetime format)
title
Title of the news article
text
Full text/content of the news article
language
Language of the article (e.g., English)
site_url
Source website URL
main_img_url
URL of the main image used in the article
type
Type/category of the news (e.g., news, opinion, satire)
label
Target variable: True for fake news, False for real news
hasImage
Indicates whether the article has an image (1 for yes, 0 for no)
pub_date
Publication date in string format
title_len
Length of the title (number of characters)
text_len
Length of the article content (number of characters)


Problem Statements:-
1). Detect fake news from articles using basic features such as article text, category (type), language, and the presence of images.
2). Analyze patterns in news characteristics, including title length, text length, article type, language, and whether an image is included, to understand differences between real and fake news.
3). Explore relationships between different features to identify possible indicators or common traits associated with fake news articles.
4). Identify which features (e.g., article length, presence of images, type of news) are most commonly found in fake news articles.
5).Compare publishing behavior (such as publishing time, day, or frequency) between fake and real news articles.
